### Security Considerations
- Admin panel should be secured in production
- Consider adding authentication for admin access
- Database connections should use secure credentials
- HTTPS recommended for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Admin panel not loading**:
   - Ensure backend server is running
   - Check that `admin_panel/index.html` exists
   - Verify port 8000 is not blocked

2. **API calls failing**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured
   - Verify database connection

3. **Data not updating**:
   - Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5)
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Verify database write permissions

### Development

To modify the admin panel:

1. Edit `admin_panel/index.html` for interface changes
2. Modify `admin_routes.py` for API changes
3. Update database models in `models.py` if needed
4. Restart the backend server to apply changes

## Production Deployment

For production use:

1. Add authentication to admin routes
2. Use HTTPS for secure connections  
3. Configure proper CORS origins
4. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
5. Set up proper logging and monitoring
6. Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx)
